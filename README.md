In this directory, you will find advanced projects carried out during the AI-ML specialization at Holberton School
## Supervised learning:

   ### **[Transfer Learning](supervised_learning/transfer_learning)**
  This repository contains a Python script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transfer learning to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset with Keras. Additionally, it includes a preprocessing function to prepare the data for training.


### **[Object detection (with Yolo)](supervised_learning/object_detection)**
  The goal of this project is to detect objects in images and videos. We will use the YOLO algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.

  ### **[Neural Style Transfer](supervised_learning/neural_style_transfer)**
  Neural Style Transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style -- and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image.
